# Bitcoin knots docker container

**notes:** This project is still under development

## About

Due to request from the [Citadel](github.com/runcitadel/) guys, and also for more client diversity. I've decided to create a docker container for the [Bitcoin Knots implementation](https://github.com/bitcoinknots/bitcoin) for bitcoin.

This is mostly the same, minus a few other differences. You may see the [original project](https://github.com/lncm/docker-bitcoind) which is mostly the same build regime.
